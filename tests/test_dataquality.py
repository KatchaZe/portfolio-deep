"""
test_dataquality — the layer that checks the DATA, not the code. Offline.

Every other guard in this repo inspects our own source. This one exists because several
defects were never code bugs: the code was correct and the data was wrong, and the code
scored it with full confidence.

    TSM     SEC companyfacts stop at FY2024 — 20 months stale on 2026-08-09 — and the
            row still scored 3.95 / HOLD-Accumulate as though current. NVO and ASML are
            foreign filers too and both carry FY2025, so this is TSM-specific and no
            amount of code review would have surfaced it.
    AVGO    no long-term debt tag for FY2022-24 -> invested capital collapsed, ROIC 130%
    ORCL    CostOfRevenue tagged only to 2018 -> a "5-year" gross margin built from 2017
    NVO     DKK financials; if the FX step is skipped, money meets a USD price

The exposure is unbounded in a way code checks are not: every new ticker brings a filing
style nobody has looked at.

Two properties are pinned:
  Q1  the checks fire on the real cases and stay quiet on the clean ones. A checker that
      flags 8 of 21 names trains its reader to ignore it, so the false-positive rate is
      part of the test.
  Q2  the stale-data fallback does not create a NEW clock mismatch. Taking fresh scalars
      from a second source while keeping SEC's older series would rebuild P3-1 inside
      the code written to fix staleness.
